# generator-gson-gwt
Code Generator that serializes Java Pojo to Json  

A small code generator for GWT. Using as input the Java/POJOs (with gson anotations) generates a utility class with from/toJSON methods.
With the utility methods it is easier to use rest like server (spring-boot) and avoid gwt-rpc / gwt-servlets / tomcat.
